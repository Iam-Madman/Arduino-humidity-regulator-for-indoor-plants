# REGULATION-OF-INDOOR-HUMIDITY-FOR-PLANT-GROWTH

Humidity can be a chief culprit when it comes to the health of
your houseplants. Most houseplants come from tropical regions
where humidity ranges between 77%-88%, almost double
compared to our home environment! In nurseries, they are also
provided with perfect humidity levels, like their native
environment.

Tropical plants don’t do well in low moisture. So, while you are
doing your best to take care of them by reading up on all their
requirements and marking the calendar for the watering
schedule, you may still end up with dry, limp leaves. The
humidity levels in your home can be the cause of any unhealthy
appearance of your indoor plants.

0% -20%: While the air is too dry for most houseplants at this level, your
cacti or succulents will be able to survive till around 10% lowest.

20% – 40%: This will be the average humidity level for most indoor places.
Some plants will survive while others, especially tropical plants, will not
flower and result in droopy leaves.

40% – 60%: This is the ideal humidity level for most houses during
summer and the perfect humidity level for most plants to flourish. With
specific ways to increase humidity, such as misting, other plants can also
easily survive. This level is also ideal for flowering and vegetation.

60% – 80%: This humidity level can be difficult and uncomfortable to
maintain at home but is perfect for a greenhouse. It’s most suitable for
tropical plants.

80% +: Though not possible at home, tropical plants such as pineapples
have incredibly high humidity requirements of around 90%! This level is
also perfect for germination and seedling growth.
